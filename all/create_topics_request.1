# create_topic_requests: An array of single topic creation requests. Can not have multiple entries for the same topic.
# topic: Name for newly created topic.
# num_partitions: Number of partitions to be created. -1 indicates unset.
# replication_factor: Replication factor for the topic. -1 indicates unset.
# replica_assignment: Replica assignment among kafka brokers for this topic partitions. If this is set num_partitions and replication_factor must be unset.
# replicas: The set of all nodes that should host this partition. The first replica in the list is the preferred leader.
# configs: Topic level configuration for topic to be set.
# config_key: Configuration key name
# config_value: Configuration value
# timeout: The time in ms to wait for a topic to be completely created on the controller node. Values <= 0 will trigger topic creation and return immediately
# validate_only: If this is true, the request will be validated, but the topic won't be created.
