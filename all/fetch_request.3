# replica_id: Broker id of the follower. For normal consumers, use -1.
# max_wait_time: Maximum time in ms to wait for the response.
# min_bytes: Minimum bytes to accumulate in the response.
# max_bytes: Maximum bytes to accumulate in the response. Note that this is not an absolute maximum, if the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the message will still be returned to ensure that progress can be made.
# topics: Topics to fetch in the order provided.
# topic: Topic to fetch.
# partitions: Partitions to fetch.
# partition: Topic partition id.
# fetch_offset: Message offset.
