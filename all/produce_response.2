# log_append_time: The timestamp returned by broker after appending the messages. If CreateTime is used for the topic, the timestamp will be -1. If LogAppendTime is used for the topic, the timestamp will be the broker local time when the messages are appended.
# throttle_time_ms: Duration in milliseconds for which the request was throttled due to quota violation. (Zero if the request did not violate any quota.)
